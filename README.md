# Nodejs Hexagonal Architecture
Hexagonal architecture, also known as ports and adapters architecture, is a design pattern that aims to decouple the application's core business logic from external dependencies. This separation makes the application more testable, maintainable, and adaptable to changes.
This repository just indicates a simple implementation of that and it's ready to be expanded and developed.
